# TF2ServerForNoobs
An all-in-1 TF2 server installation script. From fresh linux install to working Team Fortress 2 dedicated server in minutes!

This is the easiest to use "one-click" installer for a dedicated TF2 server!

This project was initially started to allow people to use cloud-based virtual private servers for hosting their own TF2 servers. Take advantage of cheaper, hourly billing by being able to quickly and effortlessly spin-up and destroy, a dedicated TF2 server.

No more messing around with SteamCMD.
